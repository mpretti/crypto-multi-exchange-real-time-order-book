# 🔍 Fee Verification System

A comprehensive system for verifying and monitoring trading fees across all supported cryptocurrency exchanges in real-time.

## 📋 Overview

The Fee Verification System ensures that your configured fees in `config.ts` are up-to-date with the latest rates from each exchange's API. It provides both command-line and web-based interfaces for monitoring fee accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**

- **7 Symbols**: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT, ADAUSDT, DOGEUSDT, XRPUSDT, LINKUSDT
- **3 Fee Types**: Maker, Taker, Funding rates

### 🔄 **Real-Time Verification**
- Fetches live fee data from exchange APIs
- Compares against configured fees in `config.ts`
- Identifies mismatches and outdated rates
- Provides detailed difference reporting

### 📊 **Multiple Interfaces**
- **Command Line**: Direct script execution
- **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful, interactive interface
- **API Integration**: Modular functions for custom use

### 📈 **Advanced Analytics**
- Success/failure rate tracking
- Mismatch detection and reporting
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, HTML)
- Real-time progress monitoring

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Command Line Interface

Run the full verification script:

```bash
# Run complete verification across all exchanges and symbols
node scripts/fee-verification.js
```

**Output Example:**
```
🔍 Starting comprehensive fee verification...

📊 Verifying fees for binance...
  ✅ BTCUSDT: Fees match
  ✅ ETHUSDT: Fees match
  ⚠️  SOLUSDT: Fee mismatch - Maker: 0.001 (config) vs 0.0008 (fetched)

📈 binance Summary: 2/3 successful, 1 mismatches

🎯 Overall Summary:
  Total verifications: 63
  Successful: 58
  Failed: 2
  Mismatches: 3
```

### 2. Web Dashboard

Access the interactive dashboard:

```bash
# Open in your browser
open fee-verification-dashboard.html
```

**Dashboard Features:**
- 🎛️ **Control Panel**: Start/stop verification, clear results
- 📊 **Real-Time Stats**: Live progress and success rates
- 🏢 **Exchange Cards**: Individual exchange status and results
- 📋 **Detailed Logs**: Comprehensive verification history
- 📤 **Export Options**: Download results in multiple formats

### 3. Programmatic Usage

Import and use the verification functions in your code:

```javascript
import { verifyAllFees, fetchExchangeFees, compareFees } from './scripts/fee-verification.js';

// Verify a single exchange/symbol
const result = await fetchExchangeFees('binance', 'BTCUSDT');

// Compare fetched fees with configured fees
const comparison = compareFees(result, configuredFees);

// Run full verification
const allResults = await verifyAllFees();
```

## 📁 File Structure

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Exchange API Endpoints

The system supports fee fetching from multiple exchange APIs:

| Exchange | Spot API | Futures API | Funding API |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Binance | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bybit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OKX | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Kraken | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Bitget | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Gate.io | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Binance US | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| MEXC | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hyperliquid | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Fee Structure

Each exchange returns fee information in this format:

```typescript
interface FeeInfo {
    maker: number;      // Maker fee as decimal (e.g., 0.001 = 0.1%)
    taker: number;      // Taker fee as decimal (e.g., 0.001 = 0.1%)
    funding: number;    // Funding fee
    source: string;     // 'spot' or 'futures'
    raw: any;          // Original API response
}
```

## 📊 Understanding Results

### Status Indicators

- ✅ **Match**: Configured fees match fetched fees
- ⚠️ **Mismatch**: Fees differ between config and API
- ❌ **Error**: Failed to fetch or parse fees
- 🔄 **Pending**: Verification not yet started

### Comparison Logic

The system compares fees with a tolerance of `0.0001` (0.01%):

```javascript
const makerDiff = Math.abs(fetchedFees.spot.maker - configuredFees.maker);
const takerDiff = Math.abs(fetchedFees.spot.taker - configuredFees.taker);
const match = makerDiff < 0.0001 && takerDiff < 0.0001;
```

### Export Formats

1. **JSON**: Complete verification results with raw data
2. **CSV**: Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis
3. **HTML**: Formatted report for sharing/presentation

## 🔄 Automation

### Scheduled Verification

Set up automated fee verification:

```bash
# Add to crontab for daily verification
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/project && node scripts/fee-verification.js >> logs/fee-verification.log 2>&1
```

### CI/CD Integration

Include fee verification in your deployment pipeline:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Verify Fees
  run: |
    node scripts/fee-verification.js
    # Fail if mismatches exceed threshold
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Fee verification failed - check for outdated rates"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: Exchanges may throttle API requests
   - **Solution**: Built-in delays between requests (100ms)

2. **API Changes**: Exchange APIs may change
   - **Solution**: Check `EXCHANGE_API_ENDPOINTS` configuration

3. **Network Issues**: Temporary connectivity problems
   - **Solution**: Retry mechanism and error reporting

4. **Symbol Mismatches**: Some symbols may not exist on all exchanges
   - **Solution**: Graceful handling with detailed error reporting

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```javascript
// Add to your verification call
const results = await verifyAllFees();
console.log('Detailed results:', JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
```

## 📈 Performance

### Benchmarks

- **Full Verification**: ~30-60 seconds (63 verifications)
- **Single Exchange**: ~5-10 seconds (7 symbols)
- **Single Symbol**: ~1-2 seconds

### Optimization Tips

1. **Selective Verification**: Use specific exchange/symbol combinations
2. **Caching**: Store results for 24 hours to reduce API calls
3. **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple exchanges simultaneously (with rate limiting)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- [ ] **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous fee monitoring with alerts
- [ ] **Historical Tracking**: Fee change history and trends
- [ ] **Automated Updates**: Auto-update config.ts with verified fees
- [ ] **Email Alerts**: Notifications for fee mismatches
- [ ] **Mobile Dashboard**: Responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] **API Rate Monitoring**: Track exchange API performance

### Contributing

To add support for new exchanges:

1. Add API endpoints to `EXCHANGE_API_ENDPOINTS`
2. Create fee parsers in `FEE_PARSERS`
3. Update `SUPPORTED_EXCHANGES` in config.ts
4. Test with the verification script

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the console logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify exchange API endpoints are accessible
4. Test with a single exchange/symbol first
